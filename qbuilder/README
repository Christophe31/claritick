This is a Django Application to use the Query Builder inside your django
website. You still have to describe the SQLAlchemy entities.

INSTALL
=======

Checkout the Query Builder as a GIT submodule :

    git submodule add rocco:/git/qbuilder.git djqbuilder

Copy or link the media in a subdirectory of your media dir :

    cp -R djqbuilder/media media/djqbuilder

    or

    ln -s djqbuilder/media media/djqbuilder

Add 'djqbuilder' to your INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py

Add this to your root 'urls.py' :

    (r'^qbuilder/',     include('djqbuilder.urls')),
